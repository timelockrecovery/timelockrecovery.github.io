Timelock Recovery is a mechanism which, in case of a catastrophic event
(death or loss of your master key), can send your Bitcoin to a secondary wallet of your choice
after a time-window (i.e. 90 days).

During that time-window, you can see that the Timelock Recovery mechanism has been triggered (a
transaction from your wallet to itself is created on the Bitcoin blockchain), and if this
has happened against your will, you can use your master key to cancel the process (by moving
the funds elsewhere before the time-window expires).

The implementation of Timelock Recovery is done with two transactions that are signed in advance,
but broadcasted only when needed:

1. An *Alert/Initiate Transaction* which sends the funds from the wallet to itself (consolidating the UTXOs).
2. A *Recovery Transaction* which sends the funds to a secondary wallet of your choice and can
be added to the blockchain only X days after the Alert Transaction has been broadcasted (and mined).

Since Timelock Recovery plans do not require any involvement of a third party, they can be
implemented in any Bitcoin wallet. However, two precautions should be taken:

1. Due to the way Bitcoin UTXOs work, spending funds from the wallet might break the entire
recovery plan.
2. Adding more funds to the wallet will not be covered by the Timelock Recovery plan.

Therefore it is highly recommended not to use the wallet for daily purposes after creating a
Timelock Recovery plan. Instead, for daily purposes use a separate wallet (with a seed in a place that
your loved ones could easily find) and only after accumulating enough funds relevant for long-term
storage, move them to a highly secure wallet (i.e. with a long passphrase that only you memorize).
The Recovery Plan should then be created for the highly secure wallet, and send the funds back to the daily-purpose wallet,
to inheritors' wallet, or to a custodian etc.

## Block explorers to manually check if the *Alert Transaction* has been broadcasted

You can enter the transaction id in the following websites:

- [mempool.space](https://mempool.space)
- [blockstream.info](https://blockstream.info)

## Apps and watchtower services to get an automatic alert if the *Alert Transaction* has been broadcasted

- [WoofBot](https://apps.umbrel.com/app/woofbot-lnd) - An app for node-runners (Umbrel) that can
monitor the Bitcoin blockchain for transaction-ids and send alerts via Telegram.

- [Cryptocurrency Alerting](https://cryptocurrencyalerting.com/wallet-watch.html) - A smartphone-app/website
that monitors the Bitcoin blockchain for changes in specified addresses, and sends alerts via email, push-notifications
and even a phone-call.
